# IntroNeuralNetworks in Python

IntroNeuralNetworks is a project that **introduces** neural networks and illustrates an example of how one can use neural networks to predict stock prices. It is built with the goal of allowing beginners to understand the fundamentals of how neural network models are built and go through the entire workflow of machine learning. This model is in no way sophisticated, so do improve upon this base project in any way. 

The core steps involved is: download stock price data from Yahoo Finance, preprocess the dataframes according to specifications for neural network libraries and finally train the neural network model and backtest over historical data. 


## Overview

The overall workflow for this project is as such:
1. Acquire the stock price data - this will give us our *features* for the model.
2. Preprocess the data - make the train and test datasets.
3. Use the neural network to learn from the training data.
4. Backtest the model across a date range.
5. Make useful stock price predictions 
6. Supplement your trading strategies with the predictions
